For my personal spending tracker I want to be able to track: 
    
    
    Goals

        SaveGoal()
        LoadGoal()

        LoadAllAccounts()
        SaveAllAccounts()



    Debt    
        CurrentDebt
            ///takes new debt and adds it to CurrentDebt. Also can reduce debt by PayDebt///
            LoadCurrentDebt()
            RecordDebt() "Creating a new account for debt"
            PayDebt()
